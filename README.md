# Mobile Flashcards

This is a productivity app created with React Native using the Expo CLI. The user can create virtual decks of flashcards, build a library of questions and answers for a specific topic and challenge himself by taking quizzes and documenting his learning progress. Daily notifications remind the user to keep at it.
